# Algorithms

In this module you'll dip your toes into the water by implementing a few algorithms. These algorithms generate different outputs depending on what we provide as input. Seen that way, the algorithms are *generic*, albeit limited to a particular kind of input. This module should be accessible with a high-school level background in mathematics.
